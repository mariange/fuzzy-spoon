Installation Guide
Three days before Black Friday, the online shopper finds his trusty tent and sets it up in the garage, ensuring that each piece is still in the bag. When it is fully assembles he nods with some satisfaction at his handiwork.

“Good, I will need this,” he says to himself, “if I plan to go camping next summer.”

Then he disassembles his tent and places it back where it was, so it’s ready come camping season.

It is still early in the morning, but the online shopper has been standing in line for a long time. He clutches his find close to his chest because he can’t afford to lose it. It was the last one of its kind on the shelf. The store is hectic, terrifying.

When he finally arrives at the cashier, she scans his items. “Just the dinner rolls?” She says.
